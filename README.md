## Introduction to the Case Study
- To understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- When the company receives a loan application, decision has to be made for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
- Decision on loan approval is linked with risks associated with business and financial loss.
- The dataset contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

- Loans with 60 months term are more likely to be default
